   - The importance of scalability and testability in Python applications
   - Overview of the Cosmic Python approach

2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
   - Understanding the principles of DDD
   - Identifying bounded contexts and domain models
   - Defining entities, value objects, and aggregates

3. Architecture Overview
   - The layered architecture of a Python application
   - Separation of concerns and responsibilities
   - The role of domain services and application services

4. Building Blocks
   - Repository pattern
   - Unit of Work pattern
   - Domain events and event handlers
   - Command and query handlers

5. Testing Strategies
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - Acceptance testing
   - Test doubles and mocking

6. Infrastructure and Persistence
   - Database integration
   - Object-relational mapping (ORM)
   - Caching and performance optimization

7. Deployment and Scaling
   - Containerization with Docker
   - Orchestration with Kubernetes
   - Load balancing and horizontal scaling

8. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

9. Advanced Topics
   - Event sourcing
   - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
   - Domain-specific languages (DSL)

10. Conclusion
    - Recap of the key concepts and principles
    - Future directions and best practices
